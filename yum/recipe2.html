      	<h3>Preheat</h3>
      	<p>oven to 350 F. Spray sides and bottom of two bread pans with nonstick cooking spray and line the bottom with parchment paper, then spray the paper.</p>

		<h3>Sift</h3> 
		<p>flours, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a medium sized bowl.</p>

		<h3>Combine</h3> 
		<p>sugar, eggs, lemon zest, and lemon juice in a food processor. While mixing, slowly add butter. Add the sour cream and vanilla and pulse until combined. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl.</p>

		<h3>Fold</h3> 
		<p>in dry mixture in one-third intervals until just combined. Do not overmix.</p>

		<h3>Divide</h3> 
		<p>batter evenly between prepared pans and bake in the center of the oven for 20 minutes. </p>

		<h3>Rotate</h3> 
		<p>pans and reduce oven temperature to 325 F, then bake for another 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean. Let cool in the pans for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the syrup.

		<h3>Combine</h3> 
		<p>lemon juice and sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat. Once sugar is dissolved, cook for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p>
		
		<h3>Invert</h3> 
		<p>loaves onto a half sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Use a toothpick to poke holes in the tops and sides of the loaves.</p>

		<h3>Brush</h3> 
		<p>tops and sides of the loaves with the lemon syrup. Let the syrup soak into the cake and brush again. Let cool completely, at least 30 minutes. </p>
